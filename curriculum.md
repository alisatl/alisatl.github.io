This page comprises the courses I've taken throughout my journey of continous self-education starting during my PhD years and on. The list is not intended to cover a university level program. However, the hope is it may serve as a useful guideline to broaden, deepen, or bridge any gaps in learning towards gaining proficiency in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, as well as Computer Science fundamentals (in Python). 


While the amount of subjects and courses might be overwhelming, it's practical and totally doable to start by taking 1-2 courses from each subject that focus on different aspects (e.g., theory vs. practice) or areas.

## Other Useful Subjects 

The following subject vary from  those that are more fundamental and typically taught in the Bachelor Degree program but are useful to refresh/revisit to more in-depth gaduate degree courses that may be useful for applied NLP only to certain extent and in the volume of selected chapters.    

* Linear Algebra
* Partial Differential Equations
* Measure-Theoretic Probability
* Convex Optimization 
* Statistical Inference --_basically, similar to some fundamental readings on ML theory suggetsed above_
